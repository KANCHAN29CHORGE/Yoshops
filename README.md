I removed empty columns from the data. Then started with catagorical data type variables by appling trim, proper case formatting on the dataset.

## Data Visualization
According to the problem statements provided by the company, I started making report using different visuals. The selection of visual for the relevant data type is necessary like for date data type we can use line chart, pie chart is best for catagorical data etc.
